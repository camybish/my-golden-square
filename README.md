My Golden Square was the name of the first week of an intensive 16-week programming course at Makers Academy (not including the four weeks of pre-course material). Within this week we worked through a number of coding challenges that acclimatised us to the test-driven development practice within programming.

If you want to see this in action, grab a local copy of the repository and run the following commands.

```
# get the latest version of ruby
; rvm get stable
; rvm use ruby --latest --install --default

# Next, install bundler, which manages dependencies like RSpec
; gem install bundler

# Create a bundler project
; bundle init

# And add RSpec to your dependencies
; bundle add rspec

# to test this
; rspec
```
